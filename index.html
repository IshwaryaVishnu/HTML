		<h2>Brief about me</h2>
		<h5>Created on 24 Feb 2023</h5>
		<p>
			My name is Iswarya, and I am currently pursuing a Java internship program at Lexicon. 
      I am passionate about software development and aspire to work for a Swedish company as a software developer in the future. 
      I am determined to achieve this goal by constantly improving my skills and knowledge in Java and related technologies.
       Apart from my career goals, my biggest ambition is to build a beautiful house for my family. 
       I strongly believe that hard work and perseverance can help me accomplish my dreams, and
      I am willing to put in the effort to make them come true.

        <h3>Employee Engagement</h3>
          <p>Employee engagement refers to the level of commitment, motivation, 
            and involvement that employees have towards their work and the 
            organization they work for. It is a crucial aspect of 
            organizational performance and has been linked to several positive 
            outcomes such as higher productivity, lower turnover rates, 
            increased customer satisfaction, and better financial performance.
            Employee engagement can be improved  through various initiatives
            such as effective communication, recognition and rewards, 
            opportunities for growth and development,work-life balance, and a
            supportive and inclusive workplace culture. It is important for 
            organizations to prioritize employee engagement to foster a motivated and
            productive workforce and achieve long-term success.

          <h3>Project Management</h3>
          <p>Project management is the process of planning, organizing, and 
            coordinating resources to achieve specific goals and objectives within 
            a defined timeline and budget. It involves overseeing the entire lifecycle 
            of a project, from defining its scope, identifying its deliverables and timelines,
            assigning tasks and responsibilities to team members, and monitoring progress to
            ensure that the project is completed successfully. Project managers use various tools 
              and techniques to manage  projects efficiently, such as Gantt charts,
              critical path analysis, agile methodologies, and project management software.
              Good project management practices can lead to increased efficiency,
               cost savings, and improved outcomes for organizations.</p>
